This is work in progress.

First, built a minimalistic web framework that runs a HTTP server and routes requests to either a static file, if available,
or a handler function defined by the application. It only uses the Python standard library.

Based upon this, I'm building a tiny web app that lets you track your fitness exercises and displays stats in binary.

Storage is done in a SQLite database.
